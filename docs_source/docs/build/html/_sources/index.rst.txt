🤗 Datasets
====================

**🤗 Datasets** is a library for easily accessing and sharing AI datasets for Audio, Computer Vision, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.

Load a dataset in a single line of code, and use our powerful data processing and streaming methods to quickly get your dataset ready for training in a deep learning model. Backed by the Apache Arrow format, process large datasets with zero-copy reads without any memory constraints for optimal speed and efficiency. We also feature a deep integration with the `Hugging Face Hub <https://huggingface.co/datasets>`_, allowing you to easily load and share a dataset with the wider machine learning community.

Find your dataset today on the `Hugging Face Hub <https://huggingface.co/datasets>`_, and take an in-depth look inside of it with the live viewer.
